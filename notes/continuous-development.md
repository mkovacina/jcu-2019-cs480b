# objective
to convey the basic ideas behind continuous development methods

# tangent
“if it hurts, do it more often, and bring the pain forward.”

# notes
* development lifecycle (approximation)
	1. develop
	2. test
	3. deploy
	4. release
* continuous integration
	* running automated testing
		* unit, integration...
* continuous delivery
	* changes able to be consumed
	* manual deployment
* continuous deployment
	* changes are put into production
	* automated deployment
* continuous improvement is the focus of these methods
	* attributes
		* short cycles
			* shorter cycles necessitate smaller changes
			* smaller changes tend to be safer
			* smaller changes are easier to code review
		* feedback driven
		* incremental changes
		* predictable
			* nothing is special anymore
			* just a way of life
			* routine
			* (discipline)
		* automation 
			* testing
			* deploying
			* monitoring
	* goals
		* quality software
		* releasable at any time
		* minimize the time to deliver a software change
	* benefits
		* better software faster
			* reduced risk
			* higher quality
			* quicker to market
			* reduced cost through automation
		* high performance *TEAM*
			* reduces burnout
			* reduces pain
			* automate the boring stuff
			* time to talk to customers 
				* ok, maybe not "talk" but get feedback
		* aligns with an agile culture
* how it breaks down
	* insufficient automated testing
		* leads to lack of confidence
	* environmental differences
		* issues in production not seen in test
	* culture change is a long journey
		* undoing years of conditioning is difficult
		* legacy technology isn't the only legacy problem
	* organizational misalignment
		* everyone needs to be rowing in the same direction
	* delivering "too fast"
		* customers don't like or want it
		* regulations prevent it
		* human intervention required for verification (can't be automated)
