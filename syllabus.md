# Policies

*Policy on Class Attendance*  
Class attendance is required as part of this course. You will be awarded one point for every class period in which you are present – not counting exam days or days that class is canceled. 

Excused absences must be prearranged with the instructor. 

Attendance will be taken at every class period. 

*Policy on Late Assignments*  
An assignment will be considered late if turned in after the end of the class period in which the assignment was due. Late assignments will be penalized by a percentage reduction of 5% of the total grade for each day they are late. 


*Policy on the Documentation and Accommodation of Disabilities*  
In accordance with federal law, if you have a documented disability you may request accommodations from Student Accessibility Services (SAS). For more information go to the [accessibility page](https://jcu.edu/accessibility) or you may contact the office directly at sas@jcu.edu or 216.397.4967. Please keep in mind that accommodations are not retroactive so it is best to register at the beginning of each semester.  Only accommodations approved by SAS will be recognized in the classroom.  Please contact SAS if you have further questions.

*Academic Honesty*   
For the full JCU policy on academic honesty, please see the section on Academic Policies and Procedures in the Undergraduate Bulletin.

Academic honesty, expected of every student, is essential to the process of education and to upholding high ethical standards. Cheating, including plagiarism, inappropriate use of technology, or any other kind of unethical behavior, may subject the student to severe academic penalties, including dismissal. 

All work submitted for evaluation in a course, including tests, term papers, and computer programs, must represent only the work of the student unless indicated otherwise. Material taken from the work of others must be acknowledged. Materials submitted to fulfill requirements in one course may not be submitted in another course without prior approval of the instructor(s). 

Concerns about the propriety of obtaining outside assistance and acknowledging sources should be addressed to the instructor of the course before the work commences and as necessary as the work proceeds.

*Policy on Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Bias*
John Carroll University is committed to fostering a learning and working environment based upon open communication, mutual respect, and ethical and moral values consistent with Jesuit and Catholic traditions.

The University seeks to provide an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment, including sexual harassment. If you have experienced sexual harassment/assault/misconduct based upon gender/sex/sexual orientation, and you share this with a faculty member, the faculty member must notify the Title IX Coordinator, Eric Butler, who will discuss options with you. He can be reached at etbutler@jcu.edu or (216) 397-1559. For more information about your options and resources, please go to the [Title IX page](https://jcu.edu/title-ix), where you can file an online report. An option to report anonymously is available.

If you have experienced bias or discrimination based on race, religion, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, military or veteran status, genetic information or any factor protected by law, you are encouraged to report this via the Bias Reporting System at the [stop bias page](https://jcu.edu/student-life/student-resources/stop-bias/be-informed).
