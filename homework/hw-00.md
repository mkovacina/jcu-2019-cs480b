## Objectives
1. Become familiar with `git`
1. Become familiar with `dotnet`
1. Setup project scaffolding

## Tasks
1. Goto (https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
    * Complete *Introduction to Git Commits*
1. Review the MSDN documentation on the `dotnet` command
1. Create a github.com account
    * You may use an existing account if you with
1. Create a new repository to use for this class
    * This repository may be private
        * If private, you must add *mkovacina* as a collaborator
1. Email me (mkovacina@jcu.edu) with a link to your repository
1. Clone your repository to your local machine
    * While it is recommended to use Visual Studio
        * You may use the `git` command
        * You may use a Git client
1. Create a directory named **quotable** in your repository 
1. Create a new console project named **quotable.console** in  the **quotable** directory using the `dotnet` command
1. Create a new class library project named **quotable.core** in the **quotable** directory using the `dotnet` command
1. Add a reference to **quotable.core** for the **quotable.console** project using the `dotnet` command
1. Create a new solution named **quotable.sln** in the **quotable** directory using the `dotnet` command
1. Add **quotable.console** and **quoatable.core** to **quotable.sln** using the `dotnet` command
1. Verify that you can build using the `dotnet build` command
1. Create an interface named `RandomQuoteProvider` in the **quotable.core* project that has a method that takes in a `long` representing the number of quotes to return and returns an `IEnumerable<string>`
1. Create an implementation of `RandomQuoteProvider` called `SimpleRandomQuoteProvider`
    * For this first pass, you may hardcode at least 3 quotes
    * If the request for the number of quotes is larger than the number of quotes you have, that is fine, just return what you have
1. Inside of `Program.cs` in the `Main` function, use the interface and class you implemented to print out `N` quotes, where `N` is a parameter passed in on the command-line. 
1. Push the changes from your local repository to GitHub
