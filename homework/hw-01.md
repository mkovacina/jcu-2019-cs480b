# Homework #1

## Objectives
1. Exercise more C# basics
2. Have more time in Visual Studio

## Tasks
1. Create an interface named `RandomQuoteProvider` in the **quotable.core* project that has a method that takes in a `long` representing the number of quotes to return and returns an `IEnumerable<string>`
1. Create an implementation of `RandomQuoteProvider` called `SimpleRandomQuoteProvider`
    * For this first pass, you may hardcode at least 3 quotes
    * If the request for the number of quotes is larger than the number of quotes you have, that is fine, just return what you have
1. Inside of `Program.cs` in the `Main` function, use the interface and class you implemented to print out `N` quotes, where `N` is a parameter passed in on the command-line. 
1. Create an implementation of `RandomQuoteProvider` called `DefaultRandomQuoteGenerator`
    * The constructor should take in an `IEnumerable<string>` of quotes as data for it to work with
    * If we did not cover reading from a file, the quotes can be hard-coded, otherwise read in the quotes from a file.
1. Ensure code is commented
    * Public methods/classes/interfaces must be commented with triple slash comments
    * Internal and private concepts may be documented
1. Read [clean-code-dotnet](https://github.com/thangchung/clean-code-dotnet)
    * In your class repo, create a Markdown file (extension ".md") named "clean-code-reaction.md"
        * Identify one point that illustrated something not to do that you do or tend to do.
        * Identify one point that surprised you and explain why
        * Identify one point that you disagree with, if any, and why
1. Push the changes from your local repository to GitHub
